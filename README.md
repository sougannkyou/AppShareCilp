<h1>So what is AppShareClip anyway?</h1>
<p>
    AppShareClip is a clipboard monitor. Essentially, AppShareClip keeps in memory the things you copy to your clipboard.
    So whenever you hit Ctrl + C, Ctrl + X or you do RightClick -> Copy, AppShareClip registers what it is you've just copied so you can acces it later on.

<h1>Usage</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        The AppShareClip window is topmost. This means that even if you click away from the window, it won't go away. If you want it gone, simply click
        the red "X" on the upper right corner of the window frame. This will send the application to the task tray. Note that when you do that, AppShareClip
        continues to listen for clipboard events and you can reopen it at any time by right clicking it's icon in the task tray and then clicking
        on the 'AppShareClip' option.
    </li>
    <li>
        To completely exit the application, right click the AppShareClip icon in the task tray and then click "Quit". All your clipboard history will be lost
    </li>
    <li>
        To add a clipboard history entry, simply copy anything in your clipboard. "Cutting" something does the same.
    </li>
    <li>
        To cycle trough the list of clipboard history, you can use the "up" and "down" arrows of your keyboard or click on the "up arrow" and "down arrow"
        buttons in the graphical interface. You can also click on any entry of the list. Pressing the "Home" key on your keyboard willl select the first
        entry of the list. Similarly, pressing the "End" key will select the last entry of the lsit.
    </li>
    <li>
        To copy a clipboard entry into your clipboard, simply select it in the list and click the "Copy" button or press the "Enter" key on your keyboard.
    </li>
    <li>
        To clear the contents of your clipboard, click the "Clear" button in the graphical interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        To clear all of the clipboard history list, click the "Clear History" button in the graphical interface or press the "Delete" key of your keyboard.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>How is AppShareClip useful?</h1>
<p>
    When I'm programming, I often find myself in a situation in which I, for instance, cut a function with the intention of pasting it back
    somewhere else but I forget to paste it and copy something else in my clipboard. But wait! Now my whole function is gone! Now I have to
    Ctrl + Z to retrieve my precious code! To avoid this kind of situation is essentially why I decided to build AppShareClip.
    I found such an application is also useful in the context of a job that requires a lot of data entry.

<h1>Compatibility</h1>
<p>
    Since this application was built using WinForms, it is only compatible with Windows operating systems (as far as I know). (I know, I'm sorry but I wanted to learn
    WinForms just for the sake of it).
    So far the application has only been tested on
    <ul>
        <li>Windows 10.</li>
        <li>Windows 8.1</li>
    </ul>
